# TIFF files

Tiff files have special handling for importing.

Like all files, we upload the original, but create an optimised and thumbnail
png version.

For TIFF files, these pngs derive from the first image file found inside the
container format, which, in a file named `xxx.tif` will explode out as
`xxx.png` or `xxx.jpg`.

However, there is additional complexity with tiff files which contain layered
images.  Specifically, the layer files will explode as `xxx-n.jpg` or
`xxx-n.png` where `n` is a numeric index.

Our code looks for this special case (see `ImageOperations.checkForOutputFileChange`)
and simply moves the layer file to the expected location.
