# Configuration

Grid sources its configuration from `/etc/gu`.

We can use the [`generate-dot-properties`](../../scripts/generate-dot-properties) scripts to generate these.

Developers working at the Guardian can use the [`fetch-config.sh`](../../fetch-config.sh) script to download pre-generated files.
