    <strong>Potentially upsetting/graphic images are now blurred in the Grid with a new setting that is switched on by default.</strong>
    <p>
        Should you need to see a blurred image, simply hover over it.<br/>
        You can also hover over the title beneath the blur to see the caption
        before deciding whether to reveal the image.<br/>
        This feature is now on by default, but can be turned off/on at any time via the top-right menu.<br/>
